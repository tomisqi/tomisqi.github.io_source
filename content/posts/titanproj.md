In this post, I'll give an overview of the video game project I embarked some time ago and that has taken much longer than originally intended :P .<br>
I'll probably make this into its own tab later since there are lots to talk about in here!

## What is it?
The game is a 2D metroidvania.<br>
If you are unfamiliar with that word, a quick internet search will give you an idea, but the gist of it is that the game is non-linear in its world design.
The player is tasked with a goal and how he/she goes about reaching the destination is not entirely predetermined.<br>
Central to the metroidvania design is that there are "areas" which are inaccessible to the player until certain means to access them are obtained. Exploration is therefore central to the design and keeping a mental map of the areas is key to making progress in the game.

## Story
I cannot say much about story other than it is set in the distant future.<br>
The player controls the last human alive. Or so the story goes..<br>
A signal that looks distinctly human is received coming from an alien world. What could it be?

## Gameplay
Being a 2D metroidvania, the player will traverse the world by controlling the protagonist. The protagonist enters an alien world and must clear the challenges ahead to make progress.<br>
The gameplay loop will consist of exploring the world, clearing challenges (enemies and environment), finding items and power-ups and key locations that will let you access new areas where new challenges and exploration await.<br>

## Development
The game is developed using the Unity Engine (https://unity.com/). <br>
I have developed several "game systems" and custom inspector tools that helps us build the world. I plan to add some posts where I discuss some of these tools in detail.

## Art
The amazing art is provided by my colleague in the project: Sandro. We both are heavily involved in deciding the scope and design of the game.

## Trailer
Enough talk, see the game in action in the following trailer.
